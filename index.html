     <h2>What Are the Oil Sands?</h2>
     <p>The Alberta oil sands are one of the largest industrial projects on Earth. But their expansion comes at a great cost to the environment and to Indigenous communities whose lands are being poisoned.</p>
     <p>Bitumen extraction is extremely toxic — releasing pollutants into rivers, poisoning ecosystems, and making traditional food sources unsafe to eat.</p>
     <p>This industrial development is happening near Fort McMurray, in the heart of Treaty 8 territory, close to many Indigenous communities.</p>

   <section id="impacts">
     <h2>Environmental and Human Impacts</h2>
     <article>
       <h3>Air, Water, and Land</h3>
       <p>Extracting bitumen releases greenhouse gases and poisons water systems like the Athabasca River. Wildlife and fish are dying, and smoke stacks pollute the air people breathe.</p>
     </article>
     <article>
       <h3>Health and Culture</h3>
       <p>People in Fort Chipewyan and surrounding areas have reported higher cancer rates. Hunting, trapping, and fishing — vital cultural practices — are becoming impossible.</p>

   <section id="acfn">
     <h2>Focus on the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation (ACFN)</h2>
     <p>The ACFN have seen their traditional territory eroded by oil development. Their hunting, fishing, and trapping areas are shrinking or poisoned.</p>
     <p>Chief Allan Adam said: “Industry comes in, makes the mess, and leaves us to live with it.”</p>
     <p>ACFN continues to challenge the government and industry for violating their treaty rights and damaging their homeland.</p>

   <section id="melina">
     <h2>Melina Laboucan-Massimo</h2>
     <p>Melina is from the Lubicon Cree Nation and is a powerful voice for climate justice. She has worked with Greenpeace and Indigenous Climate Action (ICA).</p>
     <p>She advocates for a just transition and emphasizes the importance of Indigenous consent and leadership in environmental decisions.</p>
   </section>


   <section id="treaty">
     <h2>Treaty Rights & Legal Issues</h2>
     <p>The oil sands lie on Treaty 8 territory. Under Canadian law and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), Indigenous peoples must give free, prior, and informed consent to resource projects.</p>
     <p>Yet, many projects move ahead without proper consultation. Groups like ACFN continue to fight these violations in court and on the land.</p>
